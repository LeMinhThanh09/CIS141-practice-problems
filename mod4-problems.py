#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)

# A   B   A AND B   NOT B   (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
# -------------------------------------------
# T   T     T        F        T
# T   F     F        T        T
# F   T     F        F        F
# F   F     F        T        T


#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
sensor = int(input())

if sensor < 8:
    print("Headlight On")
else:
    print("Headlight Off")

#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.

money = int(input())

if money < 100:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")


#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
yourAge = int(input("Enter Your Age: "))

if yourAge < 13:
    print("You can see G film")
elif yourAge < 17:
    print("You can see PG-13 film")
elif yourAge > 18:
    print("You can see R film")

#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping
orderAmount = float(input("Enter your order amount: "))

if orderAmount < 50:
    print("Total cost = ", orderAmount + 5)
else:
    print("Total cost = ", orderAmount)
