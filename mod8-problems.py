#2. Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips. The program
should:
- Use a while loop to repeatedly ask for a hike name and distance in miles
- Save each entry to hiking_log.txt (each hike on a new line)
- When the user presses 0, exit the loop & print the contents of hiking_log.txt

#3. Create a text file called song_lyrics.txt and copy the lyrics of a song into
it. Write a Python program that:
- Reads the file
- Requests 5 inputs from the user: 5 words the user would like to count the
frequency of
- Counts how many times each word appears
- Creates a dictionary of the words and their counts
- Print the dictionary to the console
