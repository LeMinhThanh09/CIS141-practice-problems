# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.

#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."

#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)

#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.

#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.
